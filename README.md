## Milestone 1: Design and planning
The two main game mechanics that the game will be built around are vision cones and visual representation of sound to simulate a 3D FPS in 2D and to bring in the need for a strategy with stealth when playing against AI. The first mechanics listed are quite similar in effect, so another game mechanic that will be added into the game is camouflage that is dependant on the player's camouflage, lighting and environment.
